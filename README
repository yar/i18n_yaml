I18nYaml
========

I18nYaml is a simple plugin to access the i18n functions introduced in Rails 2.2.

You can split into as many yaml files as you like to organize it. Locales are stored in app/locales.

Features in version 0.0.1

* It stores basic translations in yaml files in app/locales/locale-name/*.yml.
* It strives to provide basic translations for core rails functions like date names in rails.yml.
* It provides a before_filter to get the locale from params[:locale], sessions[:locale] and ACCEPT_LANGUAGE-http-header.
* It provides a few helper methods for translating in combination with html-escaping.
* Those helper methods accept blocks, so they can be easily nested and used with Haml.

If you have any comments, please contact me. Any default translations are most welcome.
Contact me through my website: http://iain.nl/. Any email to this domain will be recieved.

A more complete manual can be found at the github's wiki: http://github.com/iain/i18n_yaml/wikis

Todos
=======

* Make a generator to add languages, based upon the translations you already have
* Write tests.......
* Add a rake task which compares your translation files to see if some translations are incomplete
* Automatically write missing.yml when a missing translation has been found


Examples
=======

  # app/controllers/application.rb
  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    I18n.default_locale = 'dutch' # if all else fails
    before_filter :set_locale
  end

  # app/locales/en-US/admin.yml
  block_user: Click to block this user
  amount_of_users:
    - one user
    - "{{count}} users"
  scoped:
    message: Foo

  # app/views/admin/index.html.erb
  <%= ht(:amount_of_users, :count => User.count)%> 
  <%= t('scoped.message') %>
  <%= l(Time.now) %>

  # app/views/admin/index.html.haml
  %p= t(:it_is_today) do |i|
    - i.today = l(Date.today) do |j|
      - j.format = :short
