I18nYaml
========

I18nYaml is a simple plugin to access the i18n functions introduced in Rails 2.2.

You can split into as many yaml files as you like to organize it. Locales are stored in app/locales.

Features in version 0.0.1

* It stores basic translations in yaml files in app/locales/locale-name/*.yml.
* It strives to provide basic translations for core rails functions like date names in rails.yml.
* It provides a before_filter to get the locale from parameter or session.
* It provides a few helper methods for translating in combination with html-escaping.

If you have any comments, please contact me. Any default translations are most welcome.
Contact me through my website: http://iain.nl/. Any email to this domain will be recieved.

Todos
=======

* Make a generator to add languages, based upon the translations you already have
* Choose which locales are allowed in your site
* Write tests.......
* Maybe add a prefered locale based upon http string or something
* Add a rake task which compares your translation files to see locate missing translations
* Automatically write missing.yml when no translation has been found.


Example
=======

  # app/controllers/application.rb
  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    before_filter :set_locale
  end

  # app/locales/en-US/admin.yml
  block_user: Click to block this user
  amount_of_users:
    - one user
    - "{{count}} users"
  scoped:
    message: Foo

  # app/views/admin/index.html.erb
  <%= ht(:amount_of_users, :count => User.count)%> 
  <%= t('scoped.message') %>
  <%= l(Time.now) %>
